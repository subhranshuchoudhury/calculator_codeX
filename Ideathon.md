## Problem Nowadays

Because of the poor tracking of soil filed and plants in realtime. It is difficult to know when we have to add pesticides or when we have to add water or we have to not.
These little things can improve 40% - 55% crop production than before.

## My Solution

Implementing **AI & ML** to this filed

```
First we need to feed the AI about different soil quality or how soil cycle works through each season. Same as for plants we need to provide every data (images) related to plant disease. By using of this soil management system the farmer can easily notified about his/her soil or plant health.

Bind soil and plant with **Weather Forecasting**

```
We all know moisture, water level, temperature and sun affect the plant and soil health enormously. We can use AL & ML to make decision for mentioned below points.

- Crop Growth.
- Fertilizer Timing and Delivery.
- Pest and Disease Control.
- Field Workability.

All the mentioned points are affected and impacted by the weather.
```

Advantages of this system

- Better crop production
- Less effort
- Less expenditure
- Production in less time
- Maintain the health of soil and plant for future farming
